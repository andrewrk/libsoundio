# libsoundio

C library providing cross-platform audio input and output. The API is
suitable for real-time software such as digital audio workstations as well
as consumer software such as music players.

This library is an abstraction; however in the delicate balance between
performance and power, and API convenience, the scale is tipped closer to
the former. Features that only exist in some sound backends are exposed.

## Features and Limitations

 * Supported operating systems:
   - Windows 7+
   - MacOS 10.10+
   - Linux 3.7+
 * Supported backends:
   - [JACK](http://jackaudio.org/)
   - [PulseAudio](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/)
   - [ALSA](http://www.alsa-project.org/)
   - [CoreAudio](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/MusicAudio/Conceptual/CoreAudioOverview/Introduction/Introduction.html)
   - [WASAPI](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd371455%28v=vs.85%29.aspx)
   - Dummy (silence)
 * Note on msvc C compiler:
   Since msvc does not provide stdatomic header, an implementation from
   https://github.com/zenny-chen/simple-stdatomic-for-VS-Clang
   to help build as C code on msvc. The code is under Apache 2.0 license.
   You need to add the header to your include path and add the source file
   to your compilation.

 * Exposes both raw devices and shared devices. Raw devices give you the best
   performance but prevent other applications from using them. Shared devices
   are default and usually provide sample rate conversion and format
   conversion.
 * Exposes both device id and friendly name. id you could save in a config file
   because it persists between devices becoming plugged and unplugged, while
   friendly name is suitable for exposing to users.
 * Supports optimal usage of each supported backend. The same API does the
   right thing whether the backend has a fixed buffer size, such as on JACK and
   CoreAudio, or whether it allows directly managing the buffer, such as on
   ALSA, PulseAudio, and WASAPI.
 * C library. Depends only on the respective backend API libraries and libc.
   Does *not* depend on libstdc++, and does *not* have exceptions, run-time type
   information, or [setjmp](http://latentcontent.net/2007/12/05/libpng-worst-api-ever/).
 * Errors are communicated via return codes, not logging to stdio.
 * Supports channel layouts (also known as channel maps), important for
   surround sound applications.
 * Ability to monitor devices and get an event when available devices change.
 * Ability to get an event when the backend is disconnected, for example when
   the JACK server or PulseAudio server shuts down.
 * Detects which input device is default and which output device is default.
 * Ability to connect to multiple backends at once. For example you could have
   an ALSA device open and a JACK device open at the same time.
 * Meticulously checks all return codes and memory allocations and uses
   meaningful error codes.
 * Exposes extra API that is only available on some backends. For example you
   can provide application name and stream names which is used by JACK and
   PulseAudio.

## Synopsis

Complete program to emit a sine wave over the default device using the best
backend:

```c
#include <soundio/soundio.h>

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <math.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    int err;
    struct SoundIo *soundio = soundio_create();
    if (!soundio) {
        fprintf(stderr, "out of memory\n");
        return 1;

### Backend Priority

When you use `soundio_connect`, libsoundio tries these backends in order.
If unable to connect to that backend, due to the backend not being installed,
or the server not running, or the platform is wrong, the next backend is tried.

 0. JACK
 0. PulseAudio
 0. ALSA (Linux)
 0. CoreAudio (OSX)
 0. WASAPI (Windows)
 0. Dummy

If you don't like this order, you can use `soundio_connect_backend` to
explicitly choose a backend to connect to. You can use `soundio_backend_count`
and `soundio_get_backend` to get the list of available backends.

[API Documentation](http://libsound.io/doc)

### Building

Install the dependencies:

 * cmake
 * ALSA library (optional)
 * libjack2 (optional)
 * libpulseaudio (optional)

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```

### Building for Windows

You can build libsoundio with [mxe](http://mxe.cc/). Follow the
[requirements](http://mxe.cc/#requirements) section to install the
packages necessary on your system. Then somewhere on your file system:

```
git clone https://github.com/mxe/mxe
cd mxe
make MXE_TARGETS='x86_64-w64-mingw32.static i686-w64-mingw32.static' gcc
```

Then in the libsoundio source directory (replace "/path/to/mxe" with the
appropriate path):

```
mkdir build-win32
cd build-win32
cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/path/to/mxe/usr/i686-w64-mingw32.static/share/cmake/mxe-conf.cmake
make
```

```
mkdir build-win64
cd build-win64
cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/path/to/mxe/usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32.static/share/cmake/mxe-conf.cmake
make
```

### Testing

For each backend, do the following:

 0. Run the unit tests: `./unit_tests`. To see test coverage, install lcov, run
   `make coverage`, and then view `coverage/index.html` in a browser.
 0. Run the example `./sio_list_devices` and make sure it does not crash, and
    the output looks good. If valgrind is available, use it.
 0. Run `./sio_list_devices --watch` and make sure it detects when you plug and
    unplug a USB microphone.
 0. Run `./sio_sine` and make sure you hear a sine wave. For backends with raw
    devices, run `./sio_sine --device id --raw` (where 'id' is a device id you
    got from `sio_list_devices` and make sure you hear a sine wave.
    - Use 'p' to test pausing, 'u' to test unpausing, 'q' to test cleanup.
    - 'c' for clear buffer. Clear buffer should not pause the stream and it
      should also not cause an underflow.
    - Use 'P' to test pausing from the callback, and then 'u' to unpause.
 0. Run `./underflow` and read the testing instructions that it prints.
 0. Run `./sio_microphone` and ensure that it is both recording and playing
    back correctly. If possible use the `--in-device` and `--out-device`
    parameters to test a USB microphone in raw mode.
 0. Run `./backend_disconnect_recover` and read the testing instructions that
    it prints.
 0. Run `./latency` and make sure the printed beeps line up with the beeps that
    you hear.

### Building the Documentation

Ensure that [doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) is installed,
then:

```
make doc
```

Then look at `html/index.html` in a browser.
